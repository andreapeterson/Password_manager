# Password_manager
Utilizing tkinter, you can save your passwords in one json file. I in no way think this is a secure or safe way to store your passwords, but it was a good project to play around in tktiner and add new things such as the pyperclip module to automatically copy the newly generated password. Another noteworthy feature is that you can search the json file to find passwords to any website (and I made sure the website name is not case-sensitive so you can enter the website name any way you would like). Also, I used if-else statements to see if you are trying to save another entry to the same website, that way you only have one entry for each website. Lastly, I used try and except statements for the issue of trying to read the json file, if the file does not already exist, it will create it, or else, if it already existed, it will update the data and save it with json.dump().

This project was exciting because I got to explore tkinter message boxes, which is something I have been waiting for when I started using Turtle. In addition, I added a couple "try, except, else" statements which I was also excited to learn because these can help in projects with minor bugs, so it was nice to start putting them to use.
